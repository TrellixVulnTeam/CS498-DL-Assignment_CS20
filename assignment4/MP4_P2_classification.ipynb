While this might be easy to do if you input unicode characters that are unique to one or a small group of languages (like \"你好\" or \"γεια σας\"), this problem is more challenging if the input only uses the available ASCII characters. In this case, something like \"těší mě\" would beome \"tesi me\" in the ascii form. This is a more challenging problem in which the language must be recognized purely by the pattern of characters rather than unique unicode characters.\n","\n","We will train an RNN to solve this problem for a small set of languages thta can be converted to romanized ASCII form. For training data it would be ideal to have a large and varied dataset in different language styles. However, it is easy to find copies of the Bible which is a large text translated to different languages but in the same easily parsable format, so we will use 20 different copies of the Bible as training data. Using the same book for all of the different languages will hopefully prevent minor overfitting that might arise if we used different books for each language (fitting to common characteristics of the individual books rather than the language)."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"t6pZzzCwnwP-"},"source":["from unidecode import unidecode as unicodeToAscii\n","\n","all_characters = string.printable\n","n_letters = len(all_characters)\n","\n","print(unicodeToAscii('těší mě'))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"7byD6roXnwP-"},"source":["# Read a file and split into lines\n","def readFile(filename):\n","    data = open(filename, encoding='utf-8').read().strip()\n","    return unicodeToAscii(data)\n","\n","def get_category_data(data_path):\n","    # Build the category_data dictionary, a list of names per language\n","    category_data = {}\n","    all_categories = []\n","    for filename in glob.glob(data_path):\n","        category = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(filename))[0].split('_')[0]\n","        all_categories.append(category)\n","        data = readFile(filename)\n","        category_data[category] = data\n","    \n","    return category_data, all_categories"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JHiuw76gnwQB"},"source":["The original text is split into two parts, train and test, so that we can make sure that the model is not simply memorizing the train data."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"qe7G1T8PnwQC"},"source":["train_data_path = 'language_data/train/*_train.txt'\n","test_data_path = 'language_data/test/*_test.txt'\n","\n","train_category_data, all_categories = get_category_data(train_data_path)\n","test_category_data, test_all_categories = get_category_data(test_data_path)\n","\n","n_languages = len(all_categories)\n","\n","print(len(all_categories))\n","print(all_categories)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"akqBZ79FnwQC"},"source":["# Data processing"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"gB_b5PzOnwQC"},"source":["def categoryFromOutput(output):\n","    top_n, top_i = output.topk(1, dim=1)\n","    category_i = top_i[:, 0]\n","    return category_i\n","\n","# Turn string into long tensor\n","def stringToTensor(string):\n","    tensor = torch.zeros(len(string), requires_grad=True).long()\n","    for c in range(len(string)):\n","        tensor[c] = all_characters.index(string[c])\n","    return tensor\n","\n","def load_random_batch(text, chunk_len, batch_size):\n","    input_data = torch.zeros(batch_size, chunk_len).long().to(device)\n","    target = torch.zeros(batch_size, 1).long().to(device)\n","    input_text = []\n","    for i in range(batch_size):\n","        category = all_categories[random.randint(0, len(all_categories) - 1)]\n","        line_start = random.randint(0, len(text[category])-chunk_len)\n","        category_tensor = torch.tensor([all_categories.index(category)], dtype=torch.long)\n","        line = text[category][line_start:line_start+chunk_len]\n","        input_text.append(line)\n","        input_data[i] = stringToTensor(line)\n","        target[i] = category_tensor\n","    return input_data, target, input_text"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZBj-FlAcnwQC"},"source":["Implement Model\n","====================\n","\n","For this classification task, we can use the same model we implement for the generation task which is located in `rnn/model.py`.
